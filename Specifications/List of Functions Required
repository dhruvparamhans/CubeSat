Functions for each of the Peripherals 

	1. PWM
		a) setPontHOn : Enable the port for the H-Bridge
		b) setPontHOff :  Disable the port for the H-Bridge 
		c) setTIM1On :  Configure Timer 1 to be used as PWM 
		d) setTIM2On :  Configure Timer 2 to be used as PWM 
		e) setTIM8On :  Configure Timer 8 to be used as PWM 
		f) setDir1 :  Set the direction for the first coil 
		g) setDir2 :  Set the direction for the second coil 
		h) setDir3 :  Set the direction for the third coil
		i) configPWM1 :  configure the PWM 1 with the correct duty cycle 
		j) configPWM2 :  configure the PWM 2 with the correct duty cycle 
		k) configPWM3 :  configure the PWM 3 with the correct duty cycle 
		l) setTIM1Off: Disable Timer 1 
		m) setTIM2Off: Disable Timer 2 
		n) setTIM8Off: Disable Time 8 


QUESTION: Do I make separate functions for enabling each of the coils or just one function that does it? 

	2.  USART 
		a) setUSART1On: Enable the USART1 
		b) setUSART2Off: Disable the USART1 

	3. ADC 
		a) convIntToASC :  Converts the integer data to a string to send to 




To do for ADCS 

	1. Understand the structure of the objets linked to each of the peripherals 
	2. Add the object ADC to the structure 
	3. Add the object TIMER to the structure 
	4. Add the object PWM to the structure 
	5. Make the dummy threads (add the necessary files) 
	6. Make dummy objects and write random stuff in them to see how everything is working 


My test case would be to run the ADC Code that I already wrote and make a thread called testThread.
